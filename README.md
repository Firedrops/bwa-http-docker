# bwa-http-docker
BWA alignment via HTTP requests

Don't run this on a public IP.  The BWA CGI `bwa.cgi` script allows passing commandline args to `bwa` as a POST parameter.  You've been warned!

### Legacy
contains older attempt in which everything up to japsa is handled by a python script in a docker.
